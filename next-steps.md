# WebRTC Implementation Next Steps

## Updated Status (May 20, 2025)

We have made significant progress with the WebRTC implementation, and we have now verified that the core WebSocket server functionality works correctly. The key findings from our latest tests:

1. ✅ **WebSocket Server Functionality Confirmed**
   - ✅ Successfully tested direct WebSocket connections to the server
   - ✅ Verified that the `simulation=true` parameter is required for testing
   - ✅ Confirmed server can accept connections, process messages, and respond appropriately
   - ✅ Tested ping/pong and transcript message flow successfully

2. ✅ **React Component Issues Isolated**
   - ✅ Identified the infinite loop issue in useAudioVisualization.ts
   - ✅ Found "Maximum update depth exceeded" errors in the React components
   - ✅ Verified that these issues are separate from the server functionality
   - ✅ Confirmed the issues are related to setState calls in useEffect hooks

3. ✅ **Documentation Updates**
   - ✅ Updated WEBRTC_TESTING.md with simulation parameter requirements
   - ✅ Added direct WebSocket testing approach to documentation
   - ✅ Updated CLAUDE.md with our latest progress
   - ✅ Enhanced fly-interview-hybrid/README.md with testing instructions

## Previously Completed Work

1. ✅ **WebRTC Manager Implementation**
   - ✅ Successfully implemented WebRTCManager component with hooks-based architecture
   - ✅ Added reduced reconnection attempts to prevent browser resource exhaustion
   - ✅ Implemented proper cleanup for resources and connection handling
   - ✅ Added audio level visualization

2. ✅ **TranscriptPanel Integration**
   - ✅ Enhanced with stronger duplicate prevention using a Set
   - ✅ Added special handling for welcome messages
   - ✅ Implemented distinction between AI and candidate speech

3. ✅ **Simulation Server**
   - ✅ Created enhanced WebSocket server with better connection handling
   - ✅ Improved dynamic host detection to work with ngrok
   - ✅ Added support for proper WebRTC SDP negotiation simulation
   - ✅ Added test transcript messages

4. ✅ **Edge Function Updates**
   - ✅ Updated interview-start function to support hybrid architecture
   - ✅ Updated transcript-processor function with speaker identification
   - ✅ Added architecture-aware routes in API

## Current High Priority Tasks

1. **Fix React Component Issues**
   - Address the infinite loop in useAudioVisualization.ts by:
     - Fixing the useEffect dependency array
     - Adding proper conditionals to prevent excessive state updates
     - Implementing better cleanup for audio resources
     - Adding component-level error boundaries
   - Refactor WebRTCManager to prevent cascading failures
   - Create a simplified version that doesn't use audio visualization for testing

2. **Create Isolated Test Components**
   - Develop a minimal WebRTC test component without audio visualization
   - Create a pure WebSocket test component separate from WebRTC
   - Add visual indicators for connection state that don't rely on audio visualization

3. **Enhance Error Handling**
   - Add graceful degradation for the audio visualization feature
   - Implement component-level error states
   - Add fallback UI for when visualization fails
   - Create better error reporting for debugging

## Medium Priority Tasks

1. **Real Interview Testing**
   - Test the entire interview flow with the hybrid architecture
   - Validate transcript storage and retrieval
   - Test with different browsers and network conditions
   - Document performance characteristics

2. **Multi-tenant Isolation**
   - Configure Fly.io for tenant-specific VM allocation
   - Implement resource limits and quota system
   - Add tenant tracking for resource usage monitoring
   - Enhance security with more robust JWT validation

3. **Monitoring and Alerting**
   - Set up WebRTC connection success rate metrics
   - Add performance tracking for SDP exchange latency
   - Create alerts for unusual failure patterns
   - Implement proper logging for production diagnostics

## Long-term Tasks

1. **Production Scaling**
   - Design scaling strategy for different tenant sizes
   - Create automated scaling based on interview volumes
   - Implement regional deployment strategy for lower latency
   - Optimize resource allocation for cost efficiency

2. **Enhanced Features**
   - Add support for video interviews
   - Implement multi-interviewer scenarios
   - Create interviewer persona selection
   - Add recording and playback capabilities
