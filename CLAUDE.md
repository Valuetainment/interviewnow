# Claude's Work Log

## Current Task (May 9, 2025)
- Fixing WebRTC integration issues in the AI Interview Insights Platform
- Successfully troubleshooted blank page in the test interface
- Reviewing previous successful WebRTC SDP proxy implementations

## Progress

### Completed
1. âœ… Identified WebRTC integration issues:
   - SDP proxy was stopped
   - Missing environment variables
   - Issues with client-side error handling

2. âœ… Fixed infrastructure:
   - Started the Fly.io SDP proxy instance
   - Set required environment variables (FLY_APP_NAME)
   - Created local .env file with SIMULATION_MODE=true

3. âœ… Enhanced SDP proxy:
   - Added transcript simulation
   - Improved message handling
   - Added better connection state tracking

4. âœ… Improved client code:
   - Enhanced WebRTCManager with better error handling
   - Added reconnection logic with exponential backoff
   - Added proper cleanup for resources
   - Added audio level visualization

### In Progress
1. âœ… Troubleshooting blank page in test interface (RESOLVED)
   - Fixed routing issue by adding a standalone route for InterviewTestProduction
   - Added demo data for testing interviews without database dependencies
   - Moved test page outside the protected dashboard layout
   - Resolved Vite dependency cache issues with forced rebuild (--force flag)
   - Created a simplified test page at /test-simple to isolate routing issues

2. âœ… Analyzing previous successful WebRTC integration (COMPLETED)
   - Reviewed documentation in consolidated-webrtc-proxy.md
   - Examined test results from previous implementation in TEST_RESULTS.md
   - Compared production-ready SDP proxy with current implementation
   - Identified key components needed for a successful implementation

3. ðŸ”„ Implementing and testing WebRTC integration
   - Created an enhanced test page that fully tests WebRTC functionality
   - Added WebRTCManager component to test page
   - Implemented connection status tracking and visualization
   - Added transcript display for simulated responses

### Next Steps
1. Test the WebRTC integration end-to-end using the enhanced test page
2. Verify that transcript simulation works correctly
3. Test with the actual Fly.io SDP proxy in simulation mode
3. Ensure proper error handling and recovery

## Commands to Run

### Start Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Start SDP Proxy (if stopped)
```bash
cd fly-interview-hybrid && fly machines start <machine-id>
```

### Redeploy SDP Proxy (after changes)
```bash
cd fly-interview-hybrid && fly deploy
```

### Deploy Edge Functions (if needed)
```bash
supabase functions deploy interview-start
supabase functions deploy transcript-processor
```
