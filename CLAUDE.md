## Hooks Architecture Implementation

The WebRTC implementation has been refactored using a hooks-based architecture with the following structure:

### Core Hooks
- **useConnectionState**: Manages connection state and provides consistent state reporting
- **useRetry**: Handles retry logic with exponential backoff
- **useAudioVisualization**: Handles audio capture and visualization

### Connection Hooks
- **useWebRTCConnection**: Manages WebRTC peer connection and ICE negotiation
- **useWebSocketConnection**: Handles WebSocket connections to the SDP proxy
- **useOpenAIConnection**: Specialized hook for direct OpenAI WebRTC connections
- **useSDPProxy**: Specialized hook for the SDP proxy architecture
- **useTranscriptManager**: Manages transcript data and storage

### Orchestration Hook
- **useWebRTC**: Main entry point that orchestrates all specialized hooks

This architecture eliminates circular dependencies and creates a more maintainable, modular system for WebRTC functionality. Each hook is focused on a specific responsibility, making the code easier to test and extend.

## Commands to Run

### Start Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Start Simulation Server (for local testing)
```bash
cd fly-interview-hybrid
node simple-server.js
```

### Start Ngrok Tunnel for Testing
```bash
# In a separate terminal
ngrok http 3001
```

When ngrok starts, it will display a URL like: `https://a1b2c3d4.ngrok.io`
Use this URL in your WebRTC testing by replacing:
- `http://` with `ws://` for WebSocket connections
- `https://` with `wss://` for secure WebSocket connections

### Testing with Ngrok URL in the App
1. Copy the ngrok URL (example: `https://a1b2c3d4.ngrok.io`)
2. Open http://localhost:8080/interview-test-simple
3. Replace the Server URL with the WebSocket version of the ngrok URL:
   - Change `https://a1b2c3d4.ngrok.io` to `wss://a1b2c3d4.ngrok.io`
4. Test the connection

### Current Ngrok URL
The current ngrok URL being used for testing is:
```
wss://4d5fb0d8191c.ngrok.app
```
This URL has been updated in both the client code (InterviewTestSimple.tsx) and server handling logic (simple-server.js) to ensure consistent connections.

### Start SDP Proxy (if stopped)
```bash
cd fly-interview-hybrid && fly machines start <machine-id>
```

### Redeploy SDP Proxy (after changes)
```bash
cd fly-interview-hybrid && fly deploy
```

### Deploy Edge Functions (if needed)
```bash
supabase functions deploy interview-start
supabase functions deploy transcript-processor
```

## Hybrid Architecture Implementation

The project now has two WebRTC implementations:

1. **Original SDP Proxy** (`fly-interview-poc/`):
   - Traditional WebRTC SDP proxy with server-side audio processing
   - Full audio transmission over WebSockets
   - Higher latency and more server resources required

2. **Hybrid OpenAI Approach** (`fly-interview-hybrid/`):
   - Uses OpenAI's native WebRTC capabilities
   - Fly.io only serves as a secure SDP exchange proxy
   - Direct WebRTC connection between client and OpenAI
   - Lower latency and more efficient resource usage

The current integration focuses on implementing the hybrid approach in the main application UI using a hooks-based architecture for better maintainability.
