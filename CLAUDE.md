## Project Status Update (May 24, 2025)

### Admin Interview Flow Implementation ✅
Successfully implemented the admin interview path with the following architecture:

#### Interview Paths Defined:
1. **Admin Interview** (Current) - Admin selects company/candidate/position manually
2. **Invitation Path** (Future) - Candidates receive email links with tokens
3. **Self-Service Path** (Much Later) - Public facing with resume upload

#### What Was Built:
- **InterviewRoomHybrid Component** (`/interview/:id`)
  - Professional interview UI without debug tools
  - Pre-interview screen showing candidate/position/company details
  - Integration with interview-start edge function
  - Real-time transcript display using TranscriptPanel
  - Clean interview controls with WebRTCManager

- **Flow Architecture**:
  ```
  TestInterview (/test-interview) → Select Company/Candidate/Position
  ↓
  Creates interview_session in database
  ↓
  Navigates to /interview/:sessionId
  ↓
  InterviewRoomHybrid loads session data
  ↓
  Admin clicks "Start Interview"
  ↓
  Calls interview-start edge function → Gets Fly.io WebSocket URL
  ↓
  WebRTC: Browser ↔ Fly.io (SDP Proxy) ↔ OpenAI
  ↓
  Real-time transcripts saved to database
  ```

#### Key Architecture Points:
- **Fly.io remains essential** for ALL interview types (security, JWT validation, SDP exchange)
- **Hybrid approach maintained**: Audio flows directly between browser and OpenAI
- **Tenant isolation**: Each interview gets a dedicated VM with tenant-specific naming
- **Consistent flow**: Same WebRTC architecture for admin, invitation, and self-service paths

#### Production Deployment Status:
- ✅ Supabase singleton issues resolved
- ✅ Vercel routing configured correctly
- ✅ All components using proper imports
- ✅ Admin interview flow integrated

### Next Steps:
1. Test the complete admin interview flow in production
2. Verify Fly.io VM provisioning and WebSocket connections
3. Confirm transcript storage and retrieval
4. Test with real OpenAI WebRTC connection (not simulation mode)
