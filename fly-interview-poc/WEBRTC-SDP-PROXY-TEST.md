# WebRTC SDP Proxy Test Documentation

## Overview
This document captures the implementation and testing of a WebRTC Session Description Protocol (SDP) proxy for the AI Interview Insights Platform. The proxy serves as a middleware between client browsers and OpenAI's speech-to-text services, handling WebRTC signaling without exposing API keys to clients.

## Implementation Details

### Architecture
- **Client**: Browser-based WebRTC application that initiates connections
- **Proxy Server**: Node.js Express server with WebSocket support
- **Target API**: OpenAI API (simulated WebRTC endpoint for testing)

### Key Components
1. **Express HTTP Server**: Handles standard HTTP requests
2. **WebSocket Server**: Manages real-time signaling for WebRTC
3. **SDP Exchange Logic**: Processes SDP offers from clients and generates compatible answers
4. **Session Management**: Tracks active connections and their states

## Technical Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: SDP Format Compatibility
**Problem**: WebRTC requires that the SDP answer maintains the exact same media lines (m-lines) in the exact same order as the offer. Our initial implementation reconstructed SDPs and resulted in the error: "The order of m-lines in answer doesn't match order in offer."

**Solution**: 
Instead of reconstructing the SDP from scratch, we now:
1. Take the client's exact SDP offer
2. Make only minimal necessary changes while preserving the structure
3. Maintain the exact same media sections in the exact same order
4. Only change attributes that need to differ in an answer (like setup role, direction)

```javascript
function createAnswerFromOffer(offerSdp) {
  // Start with the client's offer
  const lines = offerSdp.split('\r\n');
  const answer = [];
  
  // Process line by line, preserving structure
  for (let i = 0; i < lines.length; i++) {
    const line = lines[i];
    let newLine = line;
    
    // Make only necessary changes to convert offer to answer
    if (line === 'a=type:offer') {
      newLine = 'a=type:answer';
    } else if (line === 'a=setup:actpass') {
      newLine = 'a=setup:active';
    } 
    // ... other minimal changes
    
    answer.push(newLine);
  }
  
  return answer.join('\r\n') + '\r\n';
}
```

### Challenge 2: Connection Establishment
**Problem**: Establishing a successful WebRTC connection requires proper handling of ICE candidates and matching the client's security expectations.

**Solution**: 
- Maintain proper session state tracking
- Generate compatible ICE credentials and fingerprints
- Handle all required WebRTC signaling messages (SDP exchange, ICE candidates)

## Testing Results

The implementation successfully:
- Establishes WebSocket connections with clients
- Processes SDP offers from clients
- Generates valid SDP answers that maintain the exact format of offers
- Handles ICE candidate exchanges
- Establishes WebRTC connections (as confirmed by client UI status)

## Limitations & Future Work

1. **Simulation Mode**: Currently using simulated responses as OpenAI doesn't yet have a public WebRTC API endpoint
2. **ICE Candidate Handling**: Full ICE candidate trickling implementation needs enhancement
3. **Production Hardening**: Additional security, rate limiting, and error handling needed
4. **Authentication**: Integration with the platform's authentication system

## Next Steps

1. Integrate with actual OpenAI WebRTC endpoint when available
2. Add proper error handling and retry logic
3. Implement secure credential management
4. Add logging and monitoring
5. Load testing to ensure scalability
