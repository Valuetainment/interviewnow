## Front-to-Back Implementation Strategy

We're following a front-to-back implementation approach for production deployment:

1. First complete all client-side components and test locally
2. Deploy individual backend services once frontend integration is verified
3. Implement production security measures incrementally
4. Test each component thoroughly before proceeding to next integration point
5. Document implementation details continuously throughout process
6. Set specific verification points before proceeding to next phase

## Production Deployment Planning

- Create pre-deployment checklist for security verification
- Document rollback procedures in case of issues
- Specify monitoring requirements for initial deployment
- Implement canary release strategy for risk mitigation
- Create incident response plan for potential issues
- Document observability metrics for production monitoring

## Key Technical Decisions (Validated)

- [x] SDP exchange occurs through Fly.io, but actual audio/video streams go directly between client and OpenAI
- [x] API keys are never exposed to the client; all sensitive operations proxied through Fly.io
- [x] One VM per interview session for complete isolation and security (Tested locally, pending production deployment)
- [ ] JWT-based authentication for all API endpoints (Partial implementation in interview-start edge function)
- [ ] Server-side VAD (Voice Activity Detection) for optimal turn-taking
- [ ] Function calling via OpenAI for interview control (ending session, rating candidates)
- [x] Separate services for different concerns: authentication, transcript storage, video recording
- [ ] Parallel processing of audio via WebRTC and video via api.video
