- [ ] Develop tenant isolation boundary tests
- [x] Set up integration tests for complete interview flow
- [ ] Build performance benchmarking tools
- [ ] Create test data generation scripts
- [ ] Implement browser compatibility testing
- [ ] Set up continuous testing in CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Create test coverage reports and monitoring
- [ ] Develop regression test suite for critical functionality

## Monitoring & Reliability

- [x] Implement structured logging across all components
- [x] Create health check endpoints for all services
- [ ] Set up performance monitoring for critical paths
- [ ] Build error tracking and alerting system
- [ ] Implement session reconnection and recovery logic
- [ ] Create fallback modes for service degradation

- [ ] Build VM scaling and capacity planning tools
- [ ] Implement regional deployment strategy
- [ ] Create maintenance mode capability
- [ ] Develop backup and recovery procedures
- [ ] Implement blue/green deployment for zero-downtime updates
- [ ] Create canary deployment process for risk mitigation
- [ ] Set up automated rollback triggers for failed deployments
- [ ] Develop infrastructure scaling policies for load management

## Documentation

- [x] Document all API endpoints with request/response examples
- [x] Create developer onboarding guide for the codebase
- [x] Update technical architecture documentation
- [ ] Write operational runbooks for common scenarios
- [x] Document security model and considerations
- [x] Create troubleshooting guide for common issues
- [x] Update database schema documentation
- [ ] Create user documentation for interview participants
- [ ] Develop admin documentation for tenant management
- [x] Build API documentation for potential integrations
- [ ] Create deployment and scaling guides for operations team
- [ ] Document incident response procedures

## First Steps Priority (Completed)

- [x] Modify existing fly-interview-poc to implement SDP proxying
- [x] Implement and test OpenAI WebRTC direct connection in isolation (simulation mode)
- [x] Create database schema updates for the new architecture
- [x] Develop a simple React WebRTC component for testing
- [x] Implement secure API key management on Fly.io VMs

## Key Technical Decisions (Validated)

- [x] SDP exchange occurs through Fly.io, but actual audio/video streams go directly between client and OpenAI
- [x] API keys are never exposed to the client; all sensitive operations proxied through Fly.io
- [x] One VM per interview session for complete isolation and security
- [ ] JWT-based authentication for all API endpoints
- [ ] Server-side VAD (Voice Activity Detection) for optimal turn-taking
- [ ] Function calling via OpenAI for interview control (ending session, rating candidates)
- [x] Separate services for different concerns: authentication, transcript storage, video recording
- [ ] Parallel processing of audio via WebRTC and video via api.video
