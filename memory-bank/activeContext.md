# AI Interview Insights Platform - Active Context

## Current Project Status
The project has made significant progress in establishing the frontend foundation. We have set up the project structure, created layout components, and configured authentication. Most importantly, we've established a local Supabase development environment with the complete database schema and storage buckets in place. We have also completed implementation of all navigation components (Navbar, Sidebar, Header), enhanced the authentication UI with proper Supabase integration, and implemented a comprehensive dashboard overview experience. We've now completed the resume processing flow, enabling users to upload, process, and analyze candidate resumes. We've also implemented the position creation feature with AI-powered description generation and competency management. Most recently, we've implemented the interview session management interface with a comprehensive testing infrastructure, enhanced the candidate management system with People Data Labs integration, established a complete CI/CD pipeline with GitHub, Supabase, and Vercel integration, and fixed critical issues with authentication and tenant association in the production environment. The latest improvements include storage configuration in production, RLS policy fixes, and Edge Function optimization to ensure the resume processing workflow works correctly in the production environment.
