# AI Interview Insights Platform - Active Context

## Current Project Status
The project has made significant progress in establishing the frontend foundation. We have set up the project structure, created layout components, and configured authentication. Most importantly, we've established a local Supabase development environment with the complete database schema and storage buckets in place. We have also completed implementation of all navigation components (Navbar, Sidebar, Header), enhanced the authentication UI with proper Supabase integration, and implemented a comprehensive dashboard overview experience. We've now completed the resume processing flow, enabling users to upload, process, and analyze candidate resumes. We've also implemented the position creation feature with AI-powered description generation and competency management. Most recently, we've implemented the interview session management interface with a comprehensive testing infrastructure, and we've enhanced the candidate management system with People Data Labs integration.

## Recent Changes
- Implemented complete PDL integration for candidate enrichment:
  - Created database migration for candidate_profiles table
  - Implemented enrich-candidate Edge Function to integrate with PDL API
  - Updated ResumeUploader to call the enrichment function after creating a candidate
  - Created CandidateCard component with visual distinction for PDL-enriched data
  - Implemented CandidateList component with filtering and sorting
  - Updated Candidate page to use new components
- Enhanced resume processing with two-step PDF.co integration:
  - Updated process-resume Edge Function to use PDF.co's URL upload endpoint
  - Added OCR capabilities for better text extraction
  - Improved error handling and response formatting
- Optimized analyze-resume Edge Function:
  - Added response_format: "json_object" for consistent OpenAI responses
  - Implemented text cleaning for improved analysis
  - Set temperature to 0.3 for more deterministic results

## Active Decisions
1. **Edge Function Architecture**
   - Using Deno.serve as recommended by Supabase guidelines 
   - Following npm: prefixed imports for dependencies (e.g., `npm:openai@4.29.0`)
   - Providing proper CORS headers for browser compatibility
   - Setting up configuration files (deno.json, import_map.json) for consistent imports
   - Simplifying type handling to avoid compilation issues in Deno environment
   - Using `--env-file` flag with `supabase_secrets.env` for local development
   - Configured Edge Function secrets in Supabase dashboard for production

2. **PDL Integration Approach**
   - Created separate candidate_profiles table for PDL-enriched data
   - Implemented enrich-candidate Edge Function for PDL API integration
   - Using PDL_API_KEY as a Supabase secret
   - Visually distinguishing PDL-enriched data in the UI (blue text)
   - Implementing fallback logic to use resume data when PDL data is unavailable
   - Adding "Enhanced" badge to indicate profiles with PDL enrichment

3. **Candidate Display Architecture**
   - Created dedicated components for different aspects of candidate display:
     - CandidateCard for list views with responsive design
     - CandidateList with filtering and sorting capabilities
   - Implementing responsive design with grid layout
   - Adding interactive elements like social media links
   - Visual distinction for PDL-enriched data (blue text color)

4. **Position Creation Architecture**
   - Using a dedicated Edge Function (`generate-position`) for AI-powered description generation
   - Implementing a two-step process:
     1. User provides basic position information
     2. AI generates detailed description and suggests competencies
   - Using OpenAI's GPT-4o-mini for generating structured position data
   - Implementing client-side validation with zod schema

5. **Interview Session Management Approach**
   - Storing session data with references to candidates and positions
   - Implementing status tracking (scheduled, in_progress, completed, cancelled)
   - Using real-time updates for transcript display
   - Separating invitation management from session creation
   - Building dedicated interview room with media controls

6. **Testing and Environment Infrastructure**
   - Creating interactive setup scripts for environment variables
   - Implementing verification tools for API connectivity
   - Developing comprehensive testing documentation
   - Separating Edge Function testing from frontend testing
   - Using `--no-verify-jwt` flag for local Edge Function testing to bypass authentication
   - Created `check-env` Edge Function to verify API key access

## Next Steps
1. **Detailed Candidate Profile Page**
   - Create tabbed interface for different sections of candidate data
   - Implement comprehensive profile view with all PDL-enriched data
   - Add interactive elements for contact information
   - Include resume viewer integration

2. **Assessment Engine**
   - Design assessment generation UI
   - Implement weighted scoring algorithm
   - Create assessment results visualization
   - Build comparative analysis tools

3. **Transcription Improvements**
   - Optimize transcript processor for performance
   - Implement caching mechanism for audio chunks
   - Add speaker diarization for multi-participant interviews
   - Improve real-time performance

4. **Reporting and Analytics**
   - Design reporting dashboard UI
   - Implement data visualization components
   - Create export functionality
   - Build analytics based on interview data

## Dependencies and Blockers
- Need to complete the Database type definitions to include all tables
- Need to optimize Edge Functions for better scalability
- Need to implement fallback mechanisms for API failures
- Need to implement robust error logging

## Open Questions
- What tabbed sections should be included in the detailed candidate profile page?
- How should we handle cases where PDL doesn't return data for a candidate?
- How should we implement caching for transcript processing to reduce OpenAI API calls?
- What metrics should be included in the assessment engine's weighted scoring?
- How can we optimize the video/audio streaming for better performance?
- What is the best approach for implementing search across multiple data types?
