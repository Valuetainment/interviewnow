# AI Interview Insights Platform - Active Context

## Current Date: January 3, 2025

## Project Overview
AI Interview Insights Platform - A comprehensive solution for conducting and analyzing AI-powered interviews. The platform uses Supabase for backend services, React/TypeScript for the frontend, and integrates OpenAI's GPT-4o Realtime API for voice interactions.

## Current Work Focus

### Avatar Integration Attempt - BACKED OUT (January 3, 2025)

**Decision**: After attempting to integrate AKOOL avatars, we've decided to back out of the implementation. The integration was technically sound but faced practical limitations:

1. **All shared avatars were busy** - AKOOL's shared avatars (dvp_Tristan_cloth2_1080P, dvp_josh_1080P, etc.) have limited availability
2. **Timing not right** - The platform needs to focus on core interview functionality first
3. **Clean removal completed** - All avatar-related code has been cleanly removed while preserving core WebRTC functionality

### What Was Learned

The avatar integration attempt provided valuable insights:
- AKOOL's API integration pattern (direct API vs edge function approach)
- Shared avatar limitations and availability issues
- The system can gracefully handle avatar unavailability
- The integration approach was architecturally sound

### Current State

The platform is back to its stable state with:
- ✅ **Working voice interviews** via OpenAI Realtime API
- ✅ **WebRTC audio functionality** fully operational
- ✅ **Clean codebase** without avatar dependencies
- ✅ **Production deployment** stable and functional

## Recent Accomplishments

### Successfully Completed (January 3, 2025)
1. **Avatar Integration Attempt**:
   - Implemented complete avatar infrastructure (hooks, components, edge functions)
   - Created `avatar-session` and `avatar-session-simple` edge functions
   - Integrated Agora SDK for video streaming
   - Built message queue for text-to-avatar synchronization

2. **Clean Rollback**:
   - Removed all avatar-related code from `WebRTCManager.tsx`
   - Removed avatar integration from `useOpenAIConnection.ts`
   - Removed avatar hooks and components
   - Preserved all core WebRTC functionality

3. **Production Stability**:
   - Voice interviews continue to work perfectly
   - No disruption to existing functionality
   - Clean git history with proper commits

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities
1. **Focus on Core Interview Features**:
   - Enhance transcript accuracy and formatting
   - Improve interview session management
   - Add interview analytics and insights

2. **Fix Known Issues**:
   - Investigate `interview-transcript` edge function 500 errors
   - Ensure all edge functions are properly deployed and active

3. **User Experience Improvements**:
   - Better error handling and user feedback
   - Enhanced interview room UI
   - Progress indicators during interviews

### Future Considerations
- Avatar integration could be revisited when:
  - Dedicated avatars become available (vs shared)
  - Core platform features are more mature
  - Business case justifies the investment

## Technical Architecture Status

### Working Components
- ✅ **OpenAI Realtime WebRTC** - Full duplex audio communication
- ✅ **Transcript Management** - Real-time transcription (with some edge function issues)
- ✅ **Interview Sessions** - Complete CRUD operations
- ✅ **Multi-tenant Architecture** - Proper isolation and security

### Known Issues
- ❌ **interview-transcript edge function** - Returning 500 errors
- ⚠️ **Edge function verification needed** - Some functions may need redeployment

## Latest Updates (January 3, 2025)

- **Avatar integration attempted and cleanly backed out**
- **Discovered AKOOL shared avatar limitations**
- **Maintained system stability throughout the process**
- **Ready to focus on core platform enhancements**

The platform remains fully functional for voice interviews without visual avatars. The attempt provided valuable learning that can inform future decisions about avatar integration.
