# AI Interview Insights Platform - Active Context

## Current Project Status
The project has made significant progress in establishing the frontend foundation. We have set up the project structure, created layout components, and configured authentication. Most importantly, we've established a local Supabase development environment with the complete database schema and storage buckets in place. We have also completed implementation of all navigation components (Navbar, Sidebar, Header), enhanced the authentication UI with proper Supabase integration, and implemented a comprehensive dashboard overview experience. We've now completed the resume processing flow, enabling users to upload, process, and analyze candidate resumes. We've also implemented the position creation feature with AI-powered description generation and competency management. Most recently, we've implemented the interview session management interface with a comprehensive testing infrastructure, enhanced the candidate management system with People Data Labs integration, established a complete CI/CD pipeline with GitHub, Supabase, and Vercel integration, and fixed critical issues with authentication and tenant association in the production environment. The latest improvements include storage configuration in production, RLS policy fixes, Edge Function optimization to ensure the resume processing workflow works correctly in the production environment, and the implementation of a robust CandidateProfile page with proper data handling and enhanced display based on the MVP implementation patterns. We've also fixed company creation in production by addressing RLS policies and tenant_id handling, improved the UI navigation by removing redundant elements and simplifying the user experience, and fixed position creation by resolving RLS policy issues that were preventing positions from being saved to the database. We've also completed an evaluation of infrastructure platforms for interview processing, comparing E2B and Fly.io, with a recommendation to use Fly.io for its superior multi-tenant isolation, burstable CPU capacity, and better strategic alignment with our needs. Most recently, we've successfully completed a Fly.io proof-of-concept for interview transcription processing, validating the technical approach with WebSockets and real-time data transmission. We've extended our testing by deploying the proof-of-concept to Fly.io, fixing WebSocket connectivity issues, implementing simulation mode, and successfully testing multi-region deployment across Miami (US) and Frankfurt (Europe). We've documented our security findings and created a comprehensive TEST_SUMMARY.md that confirms Fly.io meets our requirements for hosting the real-time interview transcription service. We've also created comprehensive documentation of our authentication and permissions system, including both user and candidate authentication flows, and implemented database schema changes to support a multi-tenant candidate experience. We've now implemented a WebRTC SDP proxy for secure communication between clients and OpenAI's API without exposing sensitive credentials, extensively tested to ensure proper SDP handling and WebRTC connection establishment.

# Active Development Context

## Current Focus

The project is transitioning to a hybrid architecture for improved performance, security, and reliability. This architecture integrates:

1. **Fly.io** for tenant isolation, connection brokering, and secure credential management
2. **OpenAI's WebRTC API** for direct client-to-OpenAI audio streaming and real-time interactions
3. **api.video** for video recording capabilities
4. **Supabase** for database, authentication, and edge functions

We're also enhancing the authentication system to support both tenant users and candidates with different access patterns:
1. **Tenant Users**: One-to-one relationship with tenants, role-based permissions
2. **Candidates**: Many-to-many relationship with tenants, invitation-based onboarding

We've successfully implemented and tested a WebRTC SDP proxy that handles secure communication between clients and OpenAI's API without exposing sensitive credentials.

## Recent Decisions

- **Hybrid Architecture Selection**: After evaluating both the triangular and hybrid architectural approaches, we've decided to move forward with the hybrid architecture that leverages OpenAI's WebRTC capabilities for direct audio streaming while maintaining security through Fly.io's SDP proxying.
- **Account-Based Authentication**: Using invitation links that lead to account creation (magic link or Google auth) to support candidates interviewing with multiple companies
- **One-to-Many Candidate-Tenant Relationship**: Implementing database schema to support candidates interviewing with multiple companies
- **Parallel Processing**: Audio processing through OpenAI WebRTC while video recording through api.video
- **Implementation Checklist Created**: Developed a comprehensive implementation checklist (see memory-bank/hybrid-implementation-checklist.md) to guide the development process
- **Authentication Documentation**: Created comprehensive documentation for both user and candidate authentication flows
- **Multi-Tenant Candidate Model**: Implemented database schema with candidate_tenants junction table to support candidates connecting with multiple companies
- **SDP Proxy Implementation**: Successfully implemented a WebRTC SDP proxy that maintains exact format compatibility while ensuring secure API key management

## Current Challenges

- **Connection Security**: Ensuring secure authentication without exposing API keys while still enabling direct WebRTC connections
- **Integration Complexity**: Coordinating multiple services (Fly.io, OpenAI, api.video, Supabase) in a cohesive architecture
- **Tenant Isolation**: Ensuring proper multi-tenant security through Fly.io while maintaining performance
- **WebRTC Reliability**: Handling connection issues, timeouts, and reconnection in WebRTC connections
- **Cross-Tenant Authentication**: Implementing secure authentication for candidates across multiple tenants
- **Permission Management**: Ensuring proper permission enforcement across the application
- **SDP Format Compatibility**: Maintaining exact format compatibility in SDP exchanges to ensure WebRTC connections work properly

## Next Steps

1. âœ… Modify the existing fly-interview-poc to implement SDP proxying instead of full audio processing
2. Integrate the WebRTC SDP proxy with the main application
3. Create database schema updates for the new architecture
4. Develop a React WebRTC component for testing
5. Implement secure API key management on Fly.io VMs
6. Deploy the candidate authentication schema changes to production
7. Add proper error handling and reconnection logic for WebRTC connections

## Key Technical Decisions

- **SDP Exchange Approach**: SDP exchange occurs through Fly.io, but actual audio/video streams go directly between client and OpenAI
- **API Key Security**: API keys are never exposed to the client; all sensitive operations proxied through Fly.io
- **Session Isolation**: One VM per interview session for complete isolation and security
- **Authentication Method**: JWT-based authentication for all API endpoints
- **Turn Detection**: Server-side VAD (Voice Activity Detection) for optimal turn-taking
- **Candidate-Tenant Model**: Junction table for many-to-many relationships between candidates and tenants
- **Invitation System**: Secure function for generating invitation tokens that create candidate-tenant relationships
- **SDP Format Preservation**: Line-by-line processing to maintain exact SDP format compatibility

## Implementation Priorities

1. Core infrastructure setup (Fly.io VM template, secure credential storage)
2. Backend APIs and services (SDP exchange, transcript storage)
3. Database implementation (schema updates, RLS policies)
4. Client components (WebRTC connection, video recording)
5. Authentication and security (JWT validation, tenant isolation)
6. Testing (automated tests, stress testing)
7. Monitoring and reliability (logging, recovery logic)
8. Deployment and operations (automation, scaling)
9. Documentation (technical architecture, API endpoints)
