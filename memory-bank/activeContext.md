# AI Interview Insights Platform - Active Context

## Current Date: June 2, 2025

## Project Overview
AI Interview Insights Platform - A comprehensive solution for conducting and analyzing AI-powered interviews. The platform uses Supabase for backend services, React/TypeScript for the frontend, and integrates OpenAI's GPT-4o Realtime API for voice interactions.

## Latest Updates (June 2, 2025)
- **Critical Discovery**: Identified architectural mismatch in WebRTC implementation
  - Frontend sending SDP offers for WebRTC peer connection
  - Fly.io server incorrectly trying to proxy WebRTC as WebSocket
  - OpenAI supports WebRTC with ephemeral tokens (not WebSocket proxy)
- **Implemented Fix**: Transformed Fly.io server to ephemeral token provider
  - Added `/api/realtime/sessions` endpoint for token generation
  - Updated frontend hooks to use ephemeral tokens
  - Maintaining backward compatibility during transition
  - Successfully deployed backend to production
- **Ready for Testing**: Direct browser ‚Üî OpenAI WebRTC connection with ephemeral tokens

## Current State & Issues

### ‚úÖ Fix Implemented
**WebRTC Ephemeral Token Flow**
- **Backend**: Deployed `/api/realtime/sessions` endpoint to interview-hybrid-template on Fly.io
- **Frontend**: Updated useOpenAIConnection hook to fetch and use ephemeral tokens
- **Architecture**: Hybrid mode now uses direct WebRTC with OpenAI via ephemeral tokens
- **Ready**: For production testing with real interview sessions

### Current Work Focus
1. **Immediate**: Test ephemeral token flow in production
2. **Next**: Verify audio flows directly between browser and OpenAI
3. **Then**: Monitor transcript relay back to our server

### Production Status
- Edge function fix deployed (URL without `/ws` path)
- Fly.io server deployed with ephemeral token endpoint
- Frontend hooks updated to support ephemeral tokens
- Ready for production testing

## Current Project Status
The project has made significant progress in establishing the frontend foundation. We have set up the project structure, created layout components, and configured authentication. Most importantly, we've established a local Supabase development environment with the complete database schema and storage buckets in place. We have also completed implementation of all navigation components (Navbar, Sidebar, Header), enhanced the authentication UI with proper Supabase integration, and implemented a comprehensive dashboard overview experience. We've now completed the resume processing flow, enabling users to upload, process, and analyze candidate resumes. We've also implemented the position creation feature with AI-powered description generation and competency management. Most recently, we've implemented the interview session management interface with a comprehensive testing infrastructure, enhanced the candidate management system with People Data Labs integration, established a complete CI/CD pipeline with GitHub, Supabase, and Vercel integration, and fixed critical issues with authentication and tenant association in the production environment. The latest improvements include storage configuration in production, RLS policy fixes, Edge Function optimization to ensure the resume processing workflow works correctly in the production environment, and the implementation of a robust CandidateProfile page with proper data handling and enhanced display based on the MVP implementation patterns. We've also fixed company creation in production by addressing RLS policies and tenant_id handling, improved the UI navigation by removing redundant elements and simplifying the user experience, and fixed position creation by resolving RLS policy issues that were preventing positions from being saved to the database. We've also completed an evaluation of infrastructure platforms for interview processing, comparing E2B and Fly.io, with a recommendation to use Fly.io for its superior multi-tenant isolation, burstable CPU capacity, and better strategic alignment with our needs. Most recently, we've successfully completed a Fly.io proof-of-concept for interview transcription processing, validating the technical approach with WebSockets and real-time data transmission. We've extended our testing by deploying the proof-of-concept to Fly.io, fixing WebSocket connectivity issues, implementing simulation mode, and successfully testing multi-region deployment across Miami (US) and Frankfurt (Europe). We've documented our security findings and created a comprehensive TEST_SUMMARY.md that confirms Fly.io meets our requirements for hosting the real-time interview transcription service. We've also created comprehensive documentation of our authentication and permissions system, including both user and candidate authentication flows, and implemented database schema changes to support a multi-tenant candidate experience. We've completely implemented and integrated both a WebRTC SDP proxy and a hybrid OpenAI approach for real-time interview transcription. The implementation uses a sophisticated hooks-based architecture for better maintainability and has been fully integrated into the main application. Test routes are available at /test/ngrok, /test/full, /test/openai, and /test/webrtc-hooks to validate different aspects of the functionality. The WebRTC implementation has now been refactored using a hooks-based architecture that eliminates circular dependencies and creates a more maintainable, modular system. We've completed unit tests for all WebRTC hooks, fixed production routing issues, resolved JS errors in the production bundle, and cleaned up the testing structure to focus exclusively on the hybrid architecture approach. We've also implemented and tested a critical security fix in the WebRTC VM isolation model, ensuring per-session isolation instead of per-tenant isolation.

## Front-to-Back Implementation Strategy

We are following a front-to-back implementation strategy for our WebRTC functionality and production deployment:

1. **Frontend First Approach**
   - Complete all client-side components and integrations
   - Test all WebRTC functionality in local environment
   - Implement and validate hooks-based architecture
   - Create comprehensive test routes for different scenarios
   - Ensure frontend resilience with proper error handling

2. **Backend Incremental Deployment**
   - Deploy individual backend services once frontend integration is verified
   - Test each component in isolation before integrating
   - Update edge functions incrementally with backward compatibility
   - Maintain clear version tracking for all deployed functions

3. **Security Implementation**
   - Implement per-session VM isolation for complete security
   - Add JWT validation progressively to each component
   - Ensure proper tenant isolation throughout the system
   - Test security boundaries at each step

4. **Production Verification**
   - Test each component thoroughly in staging before production
   - Deploy with careful monitoring and rollback plans
   - Verify functionality with real-world test interviews
   - Document all deployment steps and verification procedures

This approach allows us to ensure that each component works correctly before integrating it into the full system, reducing the risk of cascading failures and making it easier to identify and fix issues.

   - Following Supabase guidelines for RLS policy creation
   - Using lowercase SQL for better readability and consistency
   - Creating migration files for policy changes to ensure consistency

20. **VM Isolation Security Model**
   - Implemented per-session VM isolation (one VM per interview)
   - Created unique VM naming convention: interview-{architecture}-{tenantId}-{sessionShortId}
   - Modified interview-start edge function to create unique VM per session
   - Updated WebRTC hooks to handle dynamic server URLs
   - Successfully tested local implementation
   - Documented model in docs/architecture/VM_ISOLATION.md
   - Pending production deployment following front-to-back approach
   - This provides complete separation between interviews with no data leakage
   - Improved security and resource management for multi-tenant system

## Key Technical Decisions

- **WebRTC Architecture**: Implemented hybrid OpenAI approach with hooks-based architecture, removing the original SDP proxy approach
- **SDP Exchange Approach**: SDP exchange occurs through Fly.io, but actual audio/video streams go directly between client and OpenAI
- **API Key Security**: API keys are never exposed to the client; all sensitive operations proxied through Fly.io
- **Session Isolation**: One VM per interview session for complete isolation and security (tested locally, pending production deployment)
- **Authentication Method**: JWT-based authentication for API endpoints (partial implementation in interview-start edge function)
- **Turn Detection**: Server-side VAD (Voice Activity Detection) for optimal turn-taking
- **Candidate-Tenant Model**: Junction table for many-to-many relationships between candidates and tenants
- **Invitation System**: Secure function for generating invitation tokens that create candidate-tenant relationships
- **SDP Format Preservation**: Line-by-line processing to maintain exact SDP format compatibility
- **Hooks Architecture**: Specialized hooks for different aspects of WebRTC functionality
- **WebRTC Components Structure**: Core hooks (useConnectionState, useRetry, useAudioVisualization), connection hooks (useWebRTCConnection, useWebSocketConnection, useOpenAIConnection), and orchestration hook (useWebRTC)
- **Test Architecture**: Test files for individual hooks, test pages for interactive testing, and simulation tools for local development
- **RLS Policy Structure**: Separate policies for each operation and role, proper handling of foreign key relationships with tenant verification
- **Front-to-Back Implementation**: Complete frontend components first, then deploy backend services incrementally, with security measures added progressively

## Implementation Priorities

1. Core infrastructure setup (Fly.io VM template, secure credential storage)
2. Backend APIs and services (SDP exchange, transcript storage)
3. Database implementation (schema updates, RLS policies)
4. Client components (WebRTC connection, video recording)
5. Authentication and security (JWT validation, tenant isolation)
6. Testing (automated tests, stress testing)
7. Monitoring and reliability (logging, recovery logic)
8. Deployment and operations (automation, scaling)
9. Documentation (technical architecture, API endpoints)

## WebRTC Implementation Architecture

The platform has transitioned to a hybrid architecture approach:

1. **Original SDP Proxy** (fly-interview-poc) - LEGACY/REMOVED:
   - Traditional WebRTC SDP proxy with server-side audio processing
   - Full audio transmission over WebSockets
   - Higher latency and more server resources required
   - This approach has been DEPRECATED in favor of the hybrid architecture
   - **Status: SUSPENDED in production**

2. **Hybrid OpenAI Approach** (fly-interview-hybrid) - CURRENT APPROACH:
   - Uses OpenAI's native WebRTC capabilities
   - Fly.io only serves as a secure SDP exchange proxy
   - Direct WebRTC connection between client and OpenAI
   - Lower latency and more efficient resource usage
   - **Status: Implemented and tested locally, pending production deployment**

Both architectures now use a **per-session VM isolation model**, where each interview session gets its own dedicated VM for complete isolation. This ensures proper security, performance, and tenant separation in our multi-tenant SaaS platform.

The current architecture uses a hooks-based implementation for better maintainability:

### Core WebRTC Hooks
- **useConnectionState**: Manages connection state transitions and reporting
- **useRetry**: Implements retry logic with exponential backoff
- **useAudioVisualization**: Manages audio capture and visualization

### Connection Hooks
- **useWebRTCConnection**: Handles WebRTC peer connection establishment and ICE negotiation
- **useWebSocketConnection**: Manages WebSocket connections to SDP proxy
- **useOpenAIConnection**: Specialized hook for direct OpenAI WebRTC connections
- **useSDPProxy**: Specialized hook for SDP proxy architecture
- **useTranscriptManager**: Manages transcript data and storage

### Orchestration Hook
- **useWebRTC**: Main entry point that coordinates all specialized hooks

This architecture eliminates circular dependencies and creates a more maintainable system by separating concerns into focused hooks with clear responsibilities.

### VM Isolation Security Model
- **Per-Session Isolation**: Each interview session gets its own dedicated VM
- **Complete Process Isolation**: No shared processes or memory spaces between sessions
- **Network Isolation**: Unique IP addresses and endpoints per session
- **Data Isolation**: No persistent storage between sessions
- **Automatic Cleanup**: VM destruction after session completion
- **Zero Cross-Session Access**: Prevents any potential data leakage between interviews
- **Replaced Previous Approach**: Improved from previous per-tenant isolation model

## WebRTC Implementation Status

The WebRTC implementation has been fully developed and tested locally with the following status:

1. **WebSocket Connection:** Successfully established WebSocket connections in local testing

## Development Commands

### Start Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Start Simulation Server (for local testing)
```bash
cd fly-interview-hybrid
node simple-server.js
```

### Start Ngrok Tunnel for Testing
```bash
# In a separate terminal
ngrok http 3001
```

When ngrok starts, it will display a URL like: `https://a1b2c3d4.ngrok.io`
Use this URL in your WebRTC testing by replacing:
- `http://` with `ws://` for WebSocket connections
- `https://` with `wss://` for secure WebSocket connections

### Testing with Ngrok URL in the App
1. Copy the ngrok URL (example: `https://a1b2c3d4.ngrok.io`)
2. Open http://localhost:8080/interview-test-simple
3. Replace the Server URL with the WebSocket version of the ngrok URL:
   - Change `https://a1b2c3d4.ngrok.io` to `wss://a1b2c3d4.ngrok.io`
4. Test the connection

### Current Ngrok URL
The current ngrok URL being used for testing is:
```
wss://4d5fb0d8191c.ngrok.app
```
This URL has been updated in both the client code (InterviewTestSimple.tsx) and server handling logic (simple-server.js) to ensure consistent connections.

### Start SDP Proxy (if stopped)
```bash
cd fly-interview-hybrid && fly machines start <machine-id>
```

### Redeploy SDP Proxy (after changes)
```bash
cd fly-interview-hybrid && fly deploy
```

### Deploy Edge Functions (if needed)
```bash
supabase functions deploy interview-start
supabase functions deploy transcript-processor
```
