# AI Interview Insights Platform - Active Context

## Current Project Status
The project has made significant progress in establishing the frontend foundation. We have set up the project structure, created layout components, and configured authentication. Most importantly, we've established a local Supabase development environment with the complete database schema and storage buckets in place. We have also completed implementation of all navigation components (Navbar, Sidebar, Header), enhanced the authentication UI with proper Supabase integration, and implemented a comprehensive dashboard overview experience. We've now completed the resume processing flow, enabling users to upload, process, and analyze candidate resumes. We've also implemented the position creation feature with AI-powered description generation and competency management. Most recently, we've implemented the interview session management interface with a comprehensive testing infrastructure, enhanced the candidate management system with People Data Labs integration, established a complete CI/CD pipeline with GitHub, Supabase, and Vercel integration, and fixed critical issues with authentication and tenant association in the production environment. The latest improvements include storage configuration in production, RLS policy fixes, Edge Function optimization to ensure the resume processing workflow works correctly in the production environment, and the implementation of a robust CandidateProfile page with proper data handling and enhanced display based on the MVP implementation patterns. We've also fixed company creation in production by addressing RLS policies and tenant_id handling, improved the UI navigation by removing redundant elements and simplifying the user experience, and fixed position creation by resolving RLS policy issues that were preventing positions from being saved to the database. We've also completed an evaluation of infrastructure platforms for interview processing, comparing E2B and Fly.io, with a recommendation to use Fly.io for its superior multi-tenant isolation, burstable CPU capacity, and better strategic alignment with our needs. Most recently, we've successfully completed a Fly.io proof-of-concept for interview transcription processing, validating the technical approach with WebSockets and real-time data transmission.

     - Type '{}' is missing the following properties from type 'JobPosition[]': length, pop, push, concat, and 29 more
     - Property 'length' does not exist on type 'unknown'
     - Type 'unknown' is not assignable to type 'ReactNode'

2. **Database Type Definitions**

     - Need to fix remaining type issues with array properties
     - Need to handle JSON object structures more robustly

3. **Missing Table in Production**
   - The candidate_profiles table needs to be deployed to production:
