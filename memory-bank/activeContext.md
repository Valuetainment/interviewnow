# AI Interview Insights Platform - Active Context

## Current Date: December 19, 2024

## Project Overview
AI Interview Insights Platform - A comprehensive solution for conducting and analyzing AI-powered interviews. The platform uses Supabase for backend services, React/TypeScript for the frontend, and integrates OpenAI's GPT-4o Realtime API for voice interactions.

## Current Work Focus

### ðŸŽ‰ AI Interview Context Enhancement - COMPLETED (June 13, 2025)

**Status**: Successfully implemented and deployed!

#### What Was Achieved:
1. **Fixed AI Context Issue**:
   - Discovered AI was using generic instructions instead of personalized context
   - Fixed instruction passing through WebRTCManager and hooks
   - AI now receives full candidate and position context

2. **Added Personalized Interviews**:
   - AI greets candidates by their first name
   - References specific companies from their work history
   - Asks questions based on actual experience gaps
   - Allocates time based on competency weights

3. **Created `interview-prepper` Edge Function**:
   - Pre-analyzes candidates using GPT-4o-mini
   - Generates comprehensive interview strategy
   - Provides skill matches/gaps, red/green flags
   - Suggests must-ask questions and focus areas
   - Calculates overall fit score

4. **Enhanced `interview-start` Edge Function**:
   - Fetches complete session data with joins
   - Calls interview-prepper for analysis
   - Builds personalized AI instructions
   - Passes competency weights for time allocation

### Current State

The platform now features:
- âœ… **Intelligent AI interviews** that adapt to each candidate
- âœ… **Pre-interview analysis** for targeted questioning
- âœ… **Personalized greetings** using candidate names
- âœ… **Weight-based evaluation** following competency importance
- âœ… **Context-aware questions** based on work history
- âœ… **Gap-focused interviews** that validate missing evidence
- âœ… **Working voice interviews** via OpenAI Realtime API
- âœ… **WebRTC audio functionality** fully operational
- âœ… **Transcript saving** - Fixed and verified working
- âœ… **Clean interview ending** - Fixed white screen issue
- âœ… **Sessions page** - Now loading properly without errors
- âœ… **Production deployment** - All fixes deployed and working

## Recent Accomplishments

### Successfully Completed (June 13, 2025)
1. **Sessions Page Fix**:
   - Identified react-helmet-async context issue
   - Added HelmetProvider wrapper to fix undefined context error
   - Resolved the persistent `.add()` error that was causing white screen
   - Sessions page now loads and functions properly

2. **Navigation System Understanding**:

   - Found multiple UI libraries (@radix-ui, class-variance-authority) in use
   - Documented the navigation evolution and redundancy cleanup from May 2025

3. **Transcript System Debugging**:
   - Fixed missing database column causing 500 errors
   - Created migration for source_architecture column
   - Verified edge function works properly

4. **Interview Ending Flow Fix**:
   - Added proper cleanup delay before navigation
   - Implemented loading state for End Interview button
   - Resolved white screen after ending interviews

   - Display competency weights in interview UI
   - Show AI's focus areas before interview starts
   - Create post-interview summary with scores

### Future Enhancements
1. **Interview Analytics**:
   - Build dashboard showing competency coverage
   - Track which questions map to which competencies
   - Generate automated assessment reports
   - Create candidate comparison views

2. **Advanced Features**:
   - Multi-language interview support
   - Custom AI personas for different roles
   - Integration with ATS systems
   - Automated scheduling and invitations

3. **Platform Scaling**:
