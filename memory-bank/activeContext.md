# AI Interview Insights Platform - Active Context

## Current Date: December 19, 2024

## Project Overview
AI Interview Insights Platform - A comprehensive solution for conducting and analyzing AI-powered interviews. The platform uses Supabase for backend services, React/TypeScript for the frontend, and integrates OpenAI's GPT-4o Realtime API for voice interactions.

## Current Work Focus

### AI Interview Context Enhancement Plan (December 19, 2024)

**Status**: Planning phase - Ready for implementation

#### Problem Identified:
- AI interviewer currently receives minimal context (just position title/description and candidate name)
- Missing critical information: company context, competency weights, candidate background
- Results in generic interviews that don't properly evaluate weighted competencies

#### Solution Approach:
Learning from Lovable AI's MVP pattern where candidate/position IDs flow through the entire system, we'll enhance the `interview-start` edge function to fetch and utilize comprehensive context.

#### Implementation Plan:

**Phase 1: Core Enhancement (2-3 hours)**
1. Update `interview-start` edge function:
   - Enhanced data fetching with full joins
   - Weight-based competency evaluation
   - Rich instruction generation
   - Time allocation based on competency weights

2. Key improvements:
   - Fetch complete session data including competencies with weights
   - Group competencies by weight tiers (Critical/Important/Supporting)
   - Generate time-proportional interview strategy
   - Include scoring rubric based on weights

**Phase 2: Frontend Enhancements (Optional)**
- Display competencies and weights in pre-interview screen
- Pass explicit IDs through components
- Enhanced session fetching

**Phase 3: Transcript Enhancement (Optional)**
- Add metadata to transcript entries
- Track which competencies were evaluated

#### Architecture Alignment:
- âœ… Uses existing database schema and relationships
- âœ… Follows established edge function patterns
- âœ… Maintains multi-tenant security model
- âœ… No breaking changes - fully backward compatible

### Current State

The platform now has:
- âœ… **Working voice interviews** via OpenAI Realtime API
- âœ… **WebRTC audio functionality** fully operational
- âœ… **Transcript saving** - Fixed and verified working
- âœ… **Clean interview ending** - Fixed white screen issue
- âœ… **Sessions page** - Now loading properly without errors
- âœ… **Production deployment** - All fixes deployed and working
- ðŸ”„ **Limited AI context** - Identified as next improvement area

## Recent Accomplishments

### Successfully Completed (June 12, 2025)
1. **Sessions Page Fix**:
   - Identified react-helmet-async context issue
   - Added HelmetProvider wrapper to fix undefined context error
   - Resolved the persistent `.add()` error that was causing white screen
   - Sessions page now loads and functions properly

2. **Navigation System Understanding**:
   - Discovered dual navigation system (top Navbar + dashboard Sidebar)
   - Identified that DashboardLayout uses SidebarProvider with complex state
   - Found multiple UI libraries (@radix-ui, class-variance-authority) in use
   - Documented the navigation evolution and redundancy cleanup from May 2025

### Successfully Completed (June 10, 2025)
1. **Transcript System Debugging**:
   - Fixed missing database column causing 500 errors
   - Created migration for source_architecture column
   - Verified edge function works properly

2. **Interview Ending Flow Fix**:
   - Added proper cleanup delay before navigation
   - Implemented loading state for End Interview button
   - Resolved white screen after ending interviews

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities
1. **Implement AI Context Enhancement**:
   - Update `interview-start` edge function with comprehensive data fetching
   - Add weight-based instruction generation
   - Deploy and test with existing frontend
   - Verify AI asks competency-focused questions

2. **Quick Win Implementation** (1 hour):
   - Just update edge function for immediate improvement
   - No frontend changes required initially
   - Test weight-based evaluation in interviews

3. **Testing & Validation**:
   - Create test interviews with different weight distributions
   - Verify AI allocates time based on weights
   - Check question relevance to high-weight competencies

### Future Enhancements
1. **Interview Features**:
   - Add transcript export functionality
   - Implement transcript search/filtering
   - Create interview analytics dashboard
   - Add interview insights generation

2. **Platform Improvements**:
   - Optimize bundle size and loading performance
   - Implement proper error monitoring
   - Add user feedback mechanisms
   - Enhance multi-tenant features

## Technical Architecture Status

### Working Components
- âœ… **OpenAI Realtime WebRTC** - Full duplex audio communication
- âœ… **Transcript Management** - Real-time transcription working
- âœ… **Interview Sessions** - Complete CRUD operations
- âœ… **Multi-tenant Architecture** - Proper isolation and security
- âœ… **Edge Functions** - All deployed and active
- âœ… **Navigation System** - Both Navbar and Sidebar functioning
- âœ… **React Helmet** - Properly configured with provider context

### Recently Fixed Issues
- âœ… **Sessions page white screen** - Missing HelmetProvider context (FIXED)
- âœ… **interview-transcript edge function** - Missing database column (FIXED)
- âœ… **White screen on interview end** - Navigation timing issue (FIXED)
- âœ… **Lovable-tagger plugin** - Disabled to prevent potential issues

## Latest Updates (June 12, 2025)

- **Fixed Sessions page error** - Added missing HelmetProvider context
- **Understood navigation architecture** - Documented dual nav system
- **All core features working** - Platform is stable and functional
- **Ready for feature development** - Can now focus on enhancements

The platform is now in a stable state with all critical issues resolved. The Sessions page loads properly, interviews work end-to-end with transcript saving, and the navigation system is functional. Ready to focus on feature enhancements and user experience improvements.
