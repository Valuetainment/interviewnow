# Work Summary - December 19, 2024

## Major Accomplishments

### 1. Transcript Batching Implementation âœ…
Successfully implemented and deployed transcript batching to reduce database load:

- **Problem**: ~100+ edge function calls per 45-minute interview
- **Solution**: Intelligent batching (10 entries or 5 seconds)
- **Result**: 90% reduction in database calls (now 5-10 per interview)

#### Key Components:
- Enhanced `useTranscriptManager` hook with buffering logic
- Created `interview-transcript-batch` edge function
- Added automatic fallback to individual saves
- Comprehensive test suite with 6 test scenarios
- Deployed to production (December 19, 2024 at 16:16 UTC)

### 2. Architecture Analysis - Fly.io
Discovered that Fly.io is only being used for ephemeral token generation:

- **Current**: Full VM infrastructure for a single REST API call
- **Recommendation**: Migrate to Supabase edge function
- **Benefits**: Eliminate infrastructure dependency, reduce costs, simplify operations

### 3. Documentation Updates
- Created `TRANSCRIPT_OPTIMIZATION_PLAN.md` with 6-phase roadmap
- Updated memory-bank with current progress
- Added production test checklist

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Phase 2)
1. Monitor transcript batching performance in production
2. Implement post-interview processing:
   - Aggregate transcripts
   - AI-powered competency analysis
   - Generate summaries and scores

### Short Term
1. Migrate Fly.io functionality to Supabase
2. Build interview analytics dashboard
3. Implement transcript search and export

## Metrics to Watch
- Edge function invocation count (should drop 90%)
- Batch sizes and timing patterns
- Edge function response times
- Any fallback to individual saves
