  - Enhanced CANDIDATE_AUTH_FLOW.md with multi-tenant support details
  - Updated README.md in verified-flows to include new documentation
  - Designed multi-tenant candidate authentication and invitation system
  - Created database schema changes for candidate-tenant relationships
  - Implemented secure invitation function for registration
  - Added sample code and RLS policies for both user and candidate authentication

### May 6, 2024
- Completed Fly.io proof-of-concept for interview transcription: Created an isolated test environment using Node.js/Express with WebSocket support. Built a browser-based client for audio capture using MediaRecorder API. Implemented real-time communication between client and server over WebSockets. Successfully tested session management with unique session IDs for concurrent connections. Addressed technical challenges including CORS issues and port conflicts. Created comprehensive documentation including TEST_RESULTS.md detailing findings, DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md for Fly.io deployment steps, and PRODUCTION_INTEGRATION.md for integration with the main application.
- Successfully deployed and tested the proof-of-concept to Fly.io: Fixed WebSocket connectivity issues by updating the connection URL to use dynamic host detection. Implemented simulation mode for testing without a real OpenAI API key. Added multi-region deployment across Miami (US) and Frankfurt (Europe) to test global distribution. Created comprehensive TEST_SUMMARY.md documenting deployment, performance, security, and multi-region capabilities. Validated security features including app-scoped tokens, WebSocket secure protocol, and proper secrets management. Confirmed that Fly.io meets our requirements for hosting the real-time interview transcription service.
- Updated fly-security.md with findings from our Fly.io proof-of-concept testing: Documented the security aspects of our isolated test environment, multi-region security capabilities, WebSocket security features, and secrets management effectiveness. Added comprehensive sections detailing how Fly.io's security features align with our interview platform needs.

### May 15, 2024
- Completed infrastructure platform evaluation: Evaluated E2B and Fly.io as potential platforms for interview processing infrastructure. Compared platforms on multi-tenant isolation, performance characteristics, and cost efficiency. Selected Fly.io for its superior isolation capabilities through its Apps â†’ Machines model, burstable CPU capacity ideal for interview workloads, and better strategic alignment as a general-purpose compute platform. Created documentation of architecture plan and next steps for proof-of-concept implementation.

### May 14, 2024
- Fixed positions listing page: Updated the Positions component to fetch real positions from the database instead of using mock data. This completes the end-to-end position creation workflow, where users can now create positions with AI-generated descriptions, save them to the database with proper competencies, and view them in both the listing and detail pages. Fixed RLS policies for both positions and competencies tables to ensure proper data access. Also updated CreatePosition component with improved error logging for better troubleshooting.
- Fixed position creation functionality: Identified that positions were not being saved to the database due to RLS policy issues. Discovered the root cause was a policy using a non-existent JWT claim (request.jwt.claim.tenant_id). Created migration 20250514131500_fix_positions_rls_policy.sql to implement proper RLS policies using user tenant lookup and applied granular policies for each operation type. Successfully deployed the fix to production and verified that positions can now be properly created and saved.
