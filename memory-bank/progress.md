## Recent Updates

### May 6, 2024
- Completed Fly.io proof-of-concept for interview transcription: Created an isolated test environment using Node.js/Express with WebSocket support. Built a browser-based client for audio capture using MediaRecorder API. Implemented real-time communication between client and server over WebSockets. Successfully tested session management with unique session IDs for concurrent connections. Addressed technical challenges including CORS issues and port conflicts. Created comprehensive documentation including TEST_RESULTS.md detailing findings, DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md for Fly.io deployment steps, and PRODUCTION_INTEGRATION.md for integration with the main application.

### May 15, 2024
- Completed infrastructure platform evaluation: Evaluated E2B and Fly.io as potential platforms for interview processing infrastructure. Compared platforms on multi-tenant isolation, performance characteristics, and cost efficiency. Selected Fly.io for its superior isolation capabilities through its Apps → Machines model, burstable CPU capacity ideal for interview workloads, and better strategic alignment as a general-purpose compute platform. Created documentation of architecture plan and next steps for proof-of-concept implementation.

### May 14, 2024
- Fixed positions listing page: Updated the Positions component to fetch real positions from the database instead of using mock data. This completes the end-to-end position creation workflow, where users can now create positions with AI-generated descriptions, save them to the database with proper competencies, and view them in both the listing and detail pages. Fixed RLS policies for both positions and competencies tables to ensure proper data access. Also updated CreatePosition component with improved error logging for better troubleshooting.
- Fixed position creation functionality: Identified that positions were not being saved to the database due to RLS policy issues. Discovered the root cause was a policy using a non-existent JWT claim (request.jwt.claim.tenant_id). Created migration 20250514131500_fix_positions_rls_policy.sql to implement proper RLS policies using user tenant lookup and applied granular policies for each operation type. Successfully deployed the fix to production and verified that positions can now be properly created and saved.
