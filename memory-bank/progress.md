## Recent Updates

### May 14, 2025
- Fixed positions listing page: Updated the Positions component to fetch real positions from the database instead of using mock data. This completes the end-to-end position creation workflow, where users can now create positions with AI-generated descriptions, save them to the database with proper competencies, and view them in both the listing and detail pages. Fixed RLS policies for both positions and competencies tables to ensure proper data access. Also updated CreatePosition component with improved error logging for better troubleshooting.
- Fixed position creation functionality: Identified that positions were not being saved to the database due to RLS policy issues. Discovered the root cause was a policy using a non-existent JWT claim (request.jwt.claim.tenant_id). Created migration 20250514131500_fix_positions_rls_policy.sql to implement proper RLS policies using user tenant lookup and applied granular policies for each operation type. Successfully deployed the fix to production and verified that positions can now be properly created and saved.

### May 8, 2025
- Fixed company creation in production: Identified and resolved issues with RLS policies and tenant_id handling in the companies table. Created migration 20250508000000_fix_company_creation_production.sql that made tenant_id column nullable, simplified RLS policies with a more permissive approach, and enhanced the database trigger for handling tenant_id.
- Improved UI navigation: Removed redundant navigation elements, particularly the "Resumes" section that duplicated functionality in "Candidates". Modified Navbar.tsx to hide on dashboard routes and remove redundant navigation. Updated MobileNav.tsx to match this behavior. Removed horizontal navigation bar that duplicated sidebar links, creating a cleaner UI hierarchy with sidebar for main navigation and top-right for user actions. Changes simplified the user experience while preserving all functionality, with resume upload/view capabilities integrated into the Candidates section.
- Pushed changes first to a branch "fix-company-creation" then to main.
