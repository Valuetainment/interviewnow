# Transcript Optimization Plan Summary

## Created: December 19, 2024

### Key Decisions:
1. **Phase 1 Priority**: Implement batching first for immediate 90% reduction in database calls
2. **Architecture**: Keep existing real-time flow but add intelligent buffering
3. **Analytics**: Build comprehensive post-interview processing pipeline
4. **Storage**: Implement compression and archival for cost optimization

### Quick Wins:
- Transcript batching (2-3 days, huge impact)
- Post-interview processing (enables all analytics)
- Real-time competency tracking

### Implementation Order:
1. Batching (performance)
2. Post-processing (analytics)
3. Dashboard (user value)
4. Real-time enhancements (UX)
5. Storage optimization (cost)
6. Advanced features (premium)

### Success Metrics:
- Database calls: 100+ â†’ <10 per interview
- Processing time: <30s post-interview
- Storage costs: 50% reduction with compression
- Search response: <500ms

### Next Action:
Start with Phase 1 - Update useTranscriptManager to implement batching
