# Transcript System Optimization Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation plan for optimizing the transcript system in the AI Interview Insights Platform. The current system makes hundreds of database calls per interview (one per utterance), which impacts performance and increases costs.

**Created:** December 19, 2024  
**Status:** Planning Phase

## Current Issues
1. **Performance**: ~100+ edge function calls per 45-minute interview
2. **Reliability**: Individual transcript entries can fail silently
3. **Features**: Missing search, analytics, and export capabilities
4. **Storage**: No optimization or compression for long transcripts

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Transcript Batching (Quick Win) ðŸš€
**Timeline:** 2-3 days  
**Impact:** 90% reduction in database calls

#### Tasks:
- [x] Update `useTranscriptManager` hook
  - [x] Add transcript buffer array
  - [x] Implement batch size limit (10 entries)
  - [x] Add timeout-based flushing (5 seconds)
  - [x] Create `flushTranscripts` method
  - [x] Handle component unmount cleanup

- [x] Create `interview-transcript-batch` edge function
  - [x] Accept array of transcript entries
  - [x] Validate batch size limits (max 50)
  - [x] Use database transaction for atomicity
  - [x] Return success/failure for entire batch

- [x] Update error handling
  - [x] Implement retry logic for failed batches (falls back to individual saves)
  - [ ] Add local storage fallback for offline scenarios
  - [x] Log metrics for batch sizes and timings

- [x] Testing
  - [x] Unit tests for batching logic
  - [ ] Integration tests with edge function
  - [ ] Performance benchmarking before/after

### Phase 2: Post-Interview Processing ðŸ“Š
**Timeline:** 3-4 days  
**Impact:** Enable analytics and insights

#### Database Schema Updates:
- [ ] Create migration for interview_sessions enhancements
  ```sql
  - [ ] Add full_transcript TEXT column
  - [ ] Add transcript_summary TEXT column
  - [ ] Add competency_coverage JSONB column
  - [ ] Add key_moments JSONB column
  - [ ] Add ai_assessment JSONB column
  - [ ] Add transcript_word_count INTEGER column
  - [ ] Create GIN index for full-text search
  ```

#### Edge Function Development:
- [ ] Create `interview-complete` edge function
  - [ ] Aggregate all transcript_entries into full_transcript
  - [ ] Calculate total word count and duration
  - [ ] Call OpenAI for transcript analysis
  - [ ] Generate competency coverage map
  - [ ] Extract key moments with timestamps
  - [ ] Create interview summary
  - [ ] Store all results in interview_sessions

- [ ] Update `interview-transcript` to track completion
  - [ ] Add interview progress tracking
  - [ ] Trigger completion processing when interview ends
  - [ ] Handle edge cases (abandoned interviews)

### Phase 3: Real-time Enhancements ðŸŽ¯
**Timeline:** 2-3 days  
**Impact:** Better UX during interviews

#### Transcript Intelligence:
- [ ] Add to `useOpenAIConnection` hook

  - [ ] Identify and mark key moments
  - [ ] Add sentiment analysis indicators

- [ ] Update TranscriptPanel UI
  - [ ] Show competency tags on relevant sections
  - [ ] Display coverage progress bars
  - [ ] Highlight key moments visually
  - [ ] Add timestamp navigation

- [ ] Create TranscriptMetadata component
  - [ ] Real-time word count
  - [ ] Speaking time per participant
  - [ ] Competency coverage indicators
  - [ ] Interview progress tracker

### Phase 4: Analytics Dashboard ðŸ“ˆ
**Timeline:** 4-5 days  
**Impact:** Actionable insights from interviews

#### Components to Build:
- [ ] TranscriptSearch
  - [ ] Full-text search across all interviews
  - [ ] Filter by date, candidate, position
  - [ ] Search within specific competencies
  - [ ] Export search results

- [ ] CompetencyHeatmap
  - [ ] Visual representation of coverage
  - [ ] Click to jump to transcript sections
  - [ ] Compare across multiple candidates
  - [ ] Export competency reports

- [ ] KeyMomentsTimeline
  - [ ] Chronological view of important moments
  - [ ] Categorized by type (red flag, insight, etc.)
  - [ ] Click to play audio (if available)
  - [ ] Add manual moment marking

- [ ] TranscriptExport
  - [ ] Generate PDF with formatting
  - [ ] Word document export
  - [ ] CSV for data analysis
  - [ ] Include metadata and scores

### Phase 5: Storage Optimization ðŸ’¾
**Timeline:** 2-3 days  
**Impact:** Reduced storage costs and faster access

#### Optimization Tasks:
- [ ] Implement transcript compression
  - [ ] Use zlib for text compression
  - [ ] Store compressed in database
  - [ ] Decompress on-demand
  - [ ] Benchmark space savings

- [ ] Create archival system
  - [ ] Move old transcripts to cold storage
  - [ ] Define archival rules (>90 days)
  - [ ] Implement retrieval mechanism
  - [ ] Update UI for archived items

- [ ] Add caching layer
  - [ ] Cache recent transcripts in Redis/memory
  - [ ] Implement cache invalidation
  - [ ] Add cache warming for popular items
  - [ ] Monitor cache hit rates

### Phase 6: Advanced Features ðŸŽ¨
**Timeline:** 1-2 weeks  
**Impact:** Premium features for power users

#### Features to Implement:
- [ ] AI-powered insights
  - [ ] Interview coaching suggestions
  - [ ] Question quality analysis
  - [ ] Bias detection
  - [ ] Interview style recommendations

- [ ] Collaborative features
  - [ ] Shared annotations
  - [ ] Team review workflow
  - [ ] Commenting system
