# Fly.io Integration Discovery for AI Interview Platform

## Introduction

This document explores the potential integration of [Fly.io](https://fly.io) Machines into our interview platform architecture. Fly.io provides distributed, globally-available virtual machines with ultra-fast startup times (under 1 second) and comprehensive management via both CLI and REST API.

## Current Architecture

Our interview platform currently implements a triangular architecture:

1. **Client-Side (Browser)**:
   - Captures audio/video through WebRTC
   - Processes audio into chunks (2-second intervals)
   - Converts chunks to base64
   - Sends to Edge Functions

2. **Edge Functions (Server-Side)**:
   - Receives audio chunks
   - Processes speech-to-text conversion
   - Stores transcript entries in the database
   - Broadcasts transcript updates via Supabase Realtime

3. **Database**:
   - Multi-tenant data isolation
   - Structured transcript data storage
   - Relationships between sessions, candidates, positions

## Proposed Fly.io Integration

### Architectural Changes

Similar to the E2B approach, we would replace or augment Edge Functions with Fly Machines, with each interview getting a dedicated VM:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Browser] -->|Audio/Video| B[Fly Machine]
    B -->|Processed Data| C[Edge Function - Bridge]
    C -->|Store Results| D[Database]
    C -->|Broadcast Updates| E[Supabase Realtime]
    E -->|Live Transcript| A
```

### Multi-Tenant Implementation

A key advantage of Fly.io is its hierarchical organizational structure, which maps perfectly to our multi-tenant architecture:

#### Fly Apps vs Fly Machines

**Fly Apps**:
- Function as organizational containers that group related Machines
- Provide namespace and network isolation between tenants
- Have unique subdomains (e.g., `interviews-tenant-123.fly.dev`)
- Store shared secrets and configuration (API keys, credentials)
- Control network isolation via the `network` parameter
- Manage global routing and IP addresses
- Serve as a "tenant container" in our architecture

**Fly Machines**:
- The actual VMs that run our interview processing code
- Always belong to a specific App (parent-child relationship)
- Have individual resource allocations (CPU, memory)
- Can be started/stopped/destroyed independently
- Share configuration and secrets from their parent App
- Function as "interview processors" in our architecture

#### Network Isolation Configuration

While Fly Apps provide organizational separation, explicit network rules are required to ensure complete tenant isolation:

1. Create separate private networks for each tenant app:
   ```bash
   # When creating the app
   curl -X POST \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer ${FLY_API_TOKEN}" \
     "${FLY_API_HOSTNAME}/v1/apps" \
     -d '{
       "app_name": "interviews-tenant-123",
       "org_slug": "personal",
       "network": "tenant-123-network"
     }'
   ```

2. Configure firewall rules to restrict inter-app communication:
   ```bash
   # Using flyctl to set network rules
   fly network firewall add interviews-tenant-123 \
     --source-app=interviews-tenant-123 \
     --destination=internal \
     --allow
   ```

3. Use private networking for sensitive communications between Machines within the same tenant App

#### Implementation Approach

1. Create a Fly App per tenant organization (complete tenant isolation)
2. Within each tenant app, create ephemeral Machines for individual interviews (one VM per interview)
3. Maintain complete isolation between tenants via explicit network segmentation at the App level
4. Use shared secrets at the App level for tenant-specific API keys
5. Configure machine-specific parameters like regional deployment based on interview participants

This hierarchical structure provides both the isolation we need between tenants and the flexibility to manage individual interview resources efficiently.

### Implementation Details

1. **Tenant App Creation**:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer ${FLY_API_TOKEN}" \
     "${FLY_API_HOSTNAME}/v1/apps" \
     -d '{
       "app_name": "interviews-tenant-123",
       "org_slug": "personal",
       "network": "tenant-123-network"
     }'
   ```

2. **Interview Machine Provisioning**:
   ```bash
   fly machine run \
     --app interviews-tenant-123 \
     --region ord \
     --name "interview-${SESSION_ID}" \
     --env SESSION_ID=${SESSION_ID} \
     --env TENANT_ID=${TENANT_ID} \
     --env CANDIDATE_ID=${CANDIDATE_ID} \
     --env POSITION_ID=${POSITION_ID} \
     --port 8080:http \
     --vm-memory 1024 \
     --vm-cpus 1 \
     --destroy-on-exit \
     ./interview-processor-image
   ```

3. **Audio Processing**:
   ```javascript
   // Modified processAudioChunk function
   const processAudioChunk = async (chunk, sessionId, tenantId, speaker, sequenceNumber) => {
     // Convert audio chunk to base64
     const arrayBuffer = await chunk.arrayBuffer();
     const base64Audio = btoa(/*...*/);
     
     // Send to Fly Machine endpoint
     const response = await fetch(`https://interview-${sessionId}.fly.dev/process-audio`, {
       method: 'POST',
       headers: {
         'Content-Type': 'application/json',
         'Authorization': `Bearer ${apiToken}`
       },
       body: JSON.stringify({
         audio_chunk: base64Audio,
         speaker,
         sequence_number: sequenceNumber
       })
     });
     
     // Process result
     const result = await response.json();
     
     // Update database (could be done by Fly Machine or by an Edge Function)
     // Option 1: Fly Machine updates database directly
     // Option 2: Send results to bridge Edge Function
     await supabase.functions.invoke('transcript-bridge', {
       body: {
         session_id: sessionId,
         tenant_id: tenantId,
         transcript_data: result,
         speaker,
         sequence_number: sequenceNumber,
       },
     });
   };
   ```

4. **Interview Completion and Cleanup**:
   ```javascript
   // With --destroy-on-exit flag, machine will terminate when process completes
   // Final results can be stored in the database before shutdown
   
   // Alternative: manually destroy the machine
   await fetch(`${FLY_API_HOSTNAME}/v1/apps/interviews-tenant-123/machines/${machineId}`, {
     method: 'DELETE',
     headers: {
       'Authorization': `Bearer ${FLY_API_TOKEN}`
     }
   });
   ```

### WebRTC Configuration for Real-Time Communication

Since our platform leverages OpenAI's real-time API for WebRTC functionality, our configuration needs are different from a standard WebRTC implementation:

1. **OpenAI Real-Time API Integration**:
   - The Fly Machine would handle communication with OpenAI's real-time endpoints
   - Audio streams are processed through OpenAI's infrastructure rather than directly between participants
   ```javascript
   // Example OpenAI real-time API integration in Fly Machine
   import OpenAI from 'openai';
   
   const openai = new OpenAI({
     apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
   });
   
   // Set up real-time audio stream processing
   const stream = await openai.audio.realtime.connect();
   ```

2. **Fly Proxy Configuration**:
   ```toml
   # Example fly.toml configuration for API proxying
   [[services]]
     internal_port = 8080
     protocol = "tcp"
     
     [[services.ports]]
       port = 443
     
     [[services.tcp_checks]]
       interval = "15s"
       timeout = "2s"
       grace_period = "10s"
   ```

3. **Network Optimizations**:
   - Configure Fly Machines in regions closest to OpenAI's endpoints
   - Ensure low-latency connections for real-time audio processing
   - Set appropriate timeouts for WebSocket connections

This approach leverages OpenAI's infrastructure for the complex WebRTC handling, simplifying our implementation while still requiring careful network configuration in Fly.io to ensure optimal performance.
