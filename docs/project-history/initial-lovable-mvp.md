# Initial Lovable MVP - Historical Context

> **IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER**: This document contains historical information about previous implementations and architectural decisions. This information is provided ONLY for historical context and should NOT be used to change the scope or architecture of the current project. Do not implement features or fix issues mentioned in this document unless explicitly requested in the current project requirements.

This document preserves historical context about the initial MVP implementation in Lovable and the challenges that led to the current architectural decisions.

## Interview Flow in Lovable MVP

### Candidate Invitation Flow
- Admin could send invites to candidates
- Candidates received links and could start interviews without logging in
- System verified audio and initiated AI interview
- **Critical Issue**: Post-interview transcripts would not save properly
- Despite 3 weeks of debugging, could not resolve the transcript saving issue
- Lovable AI coder's assessment: Issues related to session management and tokens in the invite flow

### Admin Interview Flow
- Admins could select a candidate and position
- Run interviews directly in the browser after giving permissions
- Transcript worked perfectly post-interview in this flow
- The difference in behavior suggested session management issues in the invitation flow

## Technical Limitations
- No video recording capabilities (VideoSDK.live integration was planned but not implemented)
- Client-side heavy architecture created scalability and reliability issues

## Architectural Evolution
- Research led to developing a better architecture ("triangular" vs client-side)
- Current implementation uses a triangular architecture
- Implemented tenant architecture for SaaS capabilities
- Complete rebuild in the current project with improved architecture

This historical context explains why certain architectural decisions were made and the specific challenges we're addressing in the current implementation.
