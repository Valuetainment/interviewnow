  ```bash
  fly apps start interview-sdp-proxy
  fly apps status interview-sdp-proxy
  fly logs interview-sdp-proxy --follow
  ```
  **Status**: Currently suspended in production
  **Impact**: All WebRTC functionality is blocked until resolved

### Environment Access

- [ ] **OpenAI API Access**
  - [ ] Valid API key with GPT-4o Realtime model access
  - [ ] Rate limits configured for production load
  - [ ] Billing alerts configured for usage monitoring
  
- [ ] **Fly.io Infrastructure**
  - [ ] Production account with appropriate limits
  - [ ] VM provisioning permissions
  - [ ] Monitoring and alerting configured
  
- [ ] **Supabase Project**
  - [ ] Production database with current schema
  - [ ] Edge functions deployed and tested
  - [ ] RLS policies validated for multi-tenant security

### Code Preparation

- [ ] **Latest Code Deployed**
  - [ ] All WebRTC fixes applied
  - [ ] VM isolation implementation included
  - [ ] Updated edge functions (v6+) deployed
  - [ ] Database migrations applied

## Infrastructure Deployment

### 1. Fly.io SDP Proxy Setup

- [ ] **VM Configuration**
  ```bash
  cd fly-interview-hybrid
  fly deploy --app interview-sdp-proxy
  ```
  
- [ ] **Health Check Verification**
  ```bash
  curl https://interview-sdp-proxy.fly.dev/health
  # Expected: {"status": "healthy", "timestamp": "..."}
  ```
  
- [ ] **WebSocket Endpoint Test**
  ```bash
  # Test WebSocket connectivity
  curl -i -N -H "Connection: Upgrade" \
    -H "Upgrade: websocket" \
    -H "Sec-WebSocket-Key: test" \
    -H "Sec-WebSocket-Version: 13" \
    https://interview-sdp-proxy.fly.dev/ws
  ```

### 2. Supabase Edge Functions

- [ ] **Deploy Updated Functions**
  ```bash
  supabase functions deploy interview-start
  supabase functions deploy transcript-processor
  ```
  
- [ ] **Verify Function Status**
  ```bash
  supabase functions list
  # Verify both functions show as deployed
  ```
  
- [ ] **Test Function Endpoints**
  ```bash
  # Test interview-start function
  curl -X POST https://your-project.supabase.co/functions/v1/interview-start \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer your-anon-key" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"test": true}'
  ```

### 3. Database Configuration
