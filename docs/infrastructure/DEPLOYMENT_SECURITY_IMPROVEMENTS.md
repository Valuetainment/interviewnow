# Deployment Security Improvements

## Current Security Concerns

Based on the review of our current development environment (see [Current Development Environment](../../current-development-env-doc)), we've identified several security concerns in our deployment process:

1. **Hard-coded API Keys in Deployment Scripts**
   - Deployment scripts contain references to hard-coded API keys
   - No secret rotation or management process exists

2. **JWT Verification Disabled**
   - All Edge Functions have JWT verification disabled in both local and production environments
   - This potentially allows unauthorized access to Edge Functions

3. **Lack of Secrets Management**
   - No formal process for secret rotation
   - API keys stored directly in environment files
   - Same API keys used across environments

4. **No Access Control for Deployments**
   - Direct push access to main branch without reviews
   - No branch protection rules
   - No deployment approval process

## Recommended Improvements

### 1. Secrets Management

- **Implement a Secrets Management System**
  - Use a dedicated secrets manager like HashiCorp Vault or AWS Secrets Manager
  - Move all API keys and sensitive credentials to the secrets manager
  - Integrate with CI/CD pipeline for secure access

- **Implement Secret Rotation**
  - Establish a regular schedule for rotating all API keys and credentials
  - Document the rotation process with clear responsibilities
  - Set up monitoring for expiring credentials

- **Environment Separation**
  - Use different API keys for development, staging, and production
  - Implement access controls for production credentials
  - Document which keys are used in which environments

### 2. JWT Verification

- **Enable JWT Verification for Edge Functions**
  - Configure proper JWT verification for all Edge Functions in production
  - Document the JWT claim structure and validation requirements
  - Implement proper error handling for authentication failures

- **Implement Role-Based Access Control**
  - Add role claims to JWT tokens
  - Configure Edge Functions to check for appropriate roles
  - Document the role requirements for each endpoint

### 3. Deployment Process Security

- **Implement Branch Protection**
  - Require pull requests for changes to main branch
  - Require code reviews before merging
  - Enable status checks to prevent broken code from being merged

- **Deployment Approval Process**
  - Implement a formal approval process for production deployments
  - Require sign-off from designated team members
  - Document who can approve different types of changes

- **Separate Development and Deployment Credentials**
  - Use different credentials for development and deployment
  - Implement least-privilege access for deployment credentials
  - Rotate deployment credentials regularly

### 4. Infrastructure Security

- **Implement Regular Security Scans**
  - Set up automated security scanning for dependencies
  - Scan infrastructure configurations for security issues
  - Document the scanning process and remediation steps

- **Network Security**
  - Implement proper network segmentation in production
  - Use private networking for database access where possible
  - Document network architecture and security controls

- **Audit Logging**
  - Implement comprehensive audit logging for all deployment actions
  - Establish log retention policies
  - Set up alerts for suspicious deployment activities

## Implementation Priorities

1. **Immediate (Next 2 Weeks)**
   - Remove hard-coded API keys from deployment scripts
   - Implement branch protection for main branch
   - Document current secrets and their usage

2. **Short-term (1-2 Months)**
   - Set up a secrets management system
   - Enable JWT verification for Edge Functions
   - Implement proper access controls for deployments

3. **Medium-term (3-6 Months)**
   - Implement automated security scanning
   - Establish regular secret rotation schedule
   - Complete audit logging implementation

## Next Steps

1. Select a secrets management solution
2. Create an inventory of all current secrets and credentials
3. Document the JWT verification requirements for Edge Functions
4. Draft branch protection rules for the GitHub repository
5. Create a deployment approval process document
