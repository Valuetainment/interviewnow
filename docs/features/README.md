## Integration with Core Platform

### Database Integration
All features integrate with the multi-tenant database schema:
- **RLS Policies**: Ensure tenant isolation across all features
- **Audit Logging**: Track all feature operations for compliance
- **Real-time Updates**: Use Supabase real-time subscriptions

### Authentication Integration
Features leverage the platform's authentication system:
- **JWT Validation**: All feature APIs validate session tokens
- **Role-based Access**: Different permissions for different user types
- **Tenant Context**: All operations include tenant validation

### WebRTC Integration
Interview features specifically integrate with the WebRTC system:
- **Session Management**: Interview sessions managed through WebRTC flows
- **Transcript Integration**: Real-time transcripts stored and processed
- **Security**: VM isolation ensures interview privacy
