# Documentation Improvement Checklist

This checklist outlines key areas to enhance our project documentation, providing a comprehensive view of our development environment, practices, and workflows.

## Documentation Structure

- [x] **Reorganize Documentation Folder Structure**
  - [x] Create dedicated folders for each documentation category
  - [x] Maintain `verified-flows` for flow-specific documentation
  - [x] Add `infrastructure` folder for environment and deployment docs
  - [x] Add `development` folder for coding standards and practices
  - [x] Add `operations` folder for maintenance procedures
  - [x] Create index files for each folder for easier navigation
