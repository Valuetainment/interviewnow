# Fly.io Interview Transcription Proof-of-Concept: Test Results

## Overview

This document summarizes the results of testing a WebSocket-based real-time interview transcription system designed for potential deployment on Fly.io. The proof-of-concept application was built to evaluate the technical feasibility of using Fly.io's infrastructure for real-time audio processing in a multi-tenant environment.

## Test Environment

- **Server**: Node.js/Express with WebSocket support
- **Client**: Browser-based audio capture using MediaRecorder API
- **Communication**: WebSocket for bidirectional real-time data
- **Transcription**: Simulated OpenAI integration (prepared for real integration)
- **Testing Method**: Local development environment, isolated from main application

## Test Objectives

1. Validate WebSocket communication for real-time audio transmission
2. Test session management for multiple interview sessions
3. Evaluate the feasibility of real-time transcription updates
4. Assess proper resource cleanup and connection handling
5. Measure potential performance characteristics
6. Prepare for Fly.io deployment

## Test Results

### 1. WebSocket Communication

**Status**: ✅ Successful

**Details**:
- Successfully established WebSocket connections between browser clients and Node.js server
- Transmitted simulated transcription data in real-time
- Handled session establishment and termination correctly
- Implemented proper CORS handling for cross-origin communication
- Managed WebSocket events (open, message, close, error)

**Challenges Resolved**:
- Fixed port conflicts (3000, 3333)
- Addressed cross-origin (CORS) issues
- Implemented proper message type handling between client and server

### 2. Session Management

**Status**: ✅ Successful

**Details**:
- Created unique session IDs for each client connection
- Maintained separate transcription state for each session
- Properly cleaned up sessions when connections closed
- Successfully tracked active sessions in server memory

### 3. Transcription Flow

**Status**: ✅ Successful (Simulated)

**Details**:
- Implemented client-side audio capture via MediaRecorder
- Simulated timestamped transcription updates
- Accumulated transcript on server side
- Sent real-time updates back to clients
- Provided final transcript on session completion

**Note**: Used simulation instead of actual OpenAI API for initial testing

### 4. Resource Handling

**Status**: ✅ Successful

**Details**:
- Properly released microphone access when sessions ended
- Closed WebSocket connections cleanly
- Removed server-side session data upon disconnection
- Managed AudioContext properly

### 5. Error Handling

**Status**: ✅ Successful

**Details**:
- Gracefully handled connection failures
- Provided meaningful error messages
- Implemented recovery mechanisms for various failure scenarios
- Added appropriate logging for debugging

## Technical Insights

1. **WebSocket Performance**: WebSockets proved to be a suitable transport mechanism for real-time audio processing, with minimal latency observed during local testing.

2. **Session Isolation**: The session management approach successfully isolated data between different client connections, which is crucial for a multi-tenant interview system.

3. **Resource Usage**: Even in simulation, the pattern of resource usage suggests that Fly.io's infrastructure should be adequate for handling multiple concurrent interview sessions.

4. **Browser Compatibility**: The solution works across modern browsers that support the MediaRecorder API and WebSockets.

5. **Architectural Pattern**: The separation of concerns between client-side audio capture and server-side processing worked well and should scale appropriately.

## Challenges Encountered

1. **Cross-Origin Communication**: Initially encountered CORS issues when connecting from different origins/ports. Resolved by implementing proper CORS headers for both HTTP and WebSocket connections.

2. **Port Conflicts**: Experienced port conflicts when running alongside the main application. Resolved by implementing dynamic port allocation and explicit connection URLs.

3. **OpenAI Integration**: Initial attempts to integrate with OpenAI's Realtime API encountered issues with the API approach. Implemented a simpler simulation approach for initial testing.

4. **Message Type Mismatch**: Encountered errors when client and server expected different message types. Resolved by standardizing message formats and adding better error handling.

## Conclusions

The proof-of-concept successfully demonstrated the technical feasibility of:

1. Using WebSockets for real-time audio transcription
2. Managing multiple concurrent interview sessions
3. Providing real-time transcript updates
4. Preparing for deployment on Fly.io's infrastructure

The isolated testing approach allowed rapid iteration and problem-solving without impacting the main application codebase.

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy to Fly.io**: Test the application in Fly.io's actual infrastructure
2. **Integrate Real OpenAI API**: Replace simulation with actual transcription
3. **Load Testing**: Evaluate performance with multiple concurrent sessions
4. **Regional Deployment**: Test multi-region deployment for global coverage
5. **Integration with Main Application**: Apply the lessons learned to integrate with the main application architecture

## Artifacts

- `index.js`: Server implementation with WebSocket support
- `public/index.html`: Client implementation with audio capture
- `Dockerfile` and `fly.toml`: Configuration for Fly.io deployment
- Other supporting files for the complete proof-of-concept
