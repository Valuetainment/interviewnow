# Fly.io Interview Transcription POC: Test Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the results of our proof-of-concept testing for deploying a WebSocket-based real-time interview transcription system on Fly.io. The tests were conducted in May 2025 using an isolated testing environment to evaluate Fly.io's suitability for our interview platform.

## Deployment Testing

### Deployment Process
- Successfully created an isolated deployment environment using `fly launch`
- Used app-scoped tokens with time-limited expiry (48 hours) for secure deployment
- Configured proper port mapping (8080) for Fly.io compatibility
- Dockerfile and fly.toml configuration worked seamlessly
- Deployment completed in approximately 1 minute

### Multi-Region Deployment
- Successfully deployed to Miami (US) region as primary location
- Extended deployment to Frankfurt (Europe) to test global distribution
- Machines provisioned quickly in both regions (under 1 minute)
- Configuration and secrets properly propagated across regions

## Performance Testing

### WebSocket Performance
- WebSocket connections established reliably
- Maintained stable connections during continuous testing
- No noticeable latency in message transmission
- Simulation mode generated 1 message per second consistently
- Clean connection termination when sessions ended

### Scaling Behavior
- Multiple machines (3 total) operated in parallel
- Horizontal scaling across regions worked as expected
- No resource contention issues observed
- Machine health checks passed consistently

## Security Testing

### Authentication & Authorization
- App-scoped token system worked effectively for deployment
- Secret management properly handled sensitive API keys
- Environment variable isolation functioned correctly

### Communication Security
- Automatic TLS termination for HTTPS worked correctly
- WSS (WebSocket Secure) connections established automatically
- CORS headers properly applied to both HTTP and WebSocket connections
- Session isolation maintained between different client connections

### Environment Isolation
- Test environment completely separated from production
- No cross-contamination of data or configurations
- Clear naming conventions prevented confusion with production resources

## Technical Challenges Resolved

1. **WebSocket Connection URL**: Fixed hardcoded localhost references to use dynamic host detection
2. **Module Import Issues**: Removed problematic OpenAI script tag causing module resolution errors
3. **API Key Simulation**: Implemented fallback mode to handle missing/invalid API keys
4. **Port Configuration**: Aligned internal and external port mappings (8080) for Fly.io compatibility

## Conclusions

Fly.io provides a robust and secure platform for our interview transcription needs:

1. **Deployment Simplicity**: Easy to deploy and configure across multiple regions
2. **Security Strength**: Built-in TLS, secret management, and isolation capabilities
3. **Performance Reliability**: Stable WebSocket connections with consistent messaging
4. **Global Distribution**: Effective multi-region deployment with consistent behavior
5. **Scaling Capabilities**: Simple horizontal scaling across regions

## Next Steps

Based on these successful tests, we recommend:

1. **OpenAI Integration**: Implement actual Whisper API integration using the provided test script
2. **Load Testing**: Conduct high-volume concurrent session testing
3. **Regional Performance Analysis**: Compare latency across different global regions
4. **Production Architecture Planning**: Design the production deployment architecture based on these findings
5. **Cost Analysis**: Analyze projected costs based on expected usage patterns

These test results confirm that Fly.io meets our requirements for hosting a real-time interview transcription service with appropriate security, performance, and global distribution capabilities.
