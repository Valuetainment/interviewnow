# Transcript Batching Production Test Checklist

**Deployment Status**: âœ… COMPLETE  
**Edge Function**: interview-transcript-batch (v1)  
**Deployed**: December 16, 2024 at 16:16 UTC

## Quick Production Test

### 1. Start a Test Interview
- Go to your production app
- Start a new interview session
- Open browser DevTools Console (F12)

### 2. Watch for Batching
During the interview, you should see:
```
Flushing 10 transcript entries for session [id]
Batch saved successfully: 10 entries
```

Instead of individual saves for each transcript.

### 3. Check Supabase Logs
Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/gypnutyegqxelvsqjedu/functions/interview-transcript-batch/logs

You should see:
- "Processing batch of X transcript entries"
- "Batch saved successfully: X entries"

### 4. Verify in Database
```sql
-- Run this query in Supabase SQL Editor
SELECT 
  DATE_TRUNC('minute', created_at) as minute,
  COUNT(*) as entries_per_minute
FROM transcript_entries
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour'
GROUP BY DATE_TRUNC('minute', created_at)
ORDER BY minute DESC;
```

## Expected Results
- **Before**: 100+ edge function calls per interview
- **After**: 5-10 edge function calls per interview
- **User Experience**: No visible change (transcripts still real-time)

## If Issues Occur
The system has automatic fallback to individual saves, so transcripts won't be lost even if batching fails.

## Success! ðŸŽ‰
Once confirmed working, the batching will automatically apply to all interviews, reducing database load by ~90%.
